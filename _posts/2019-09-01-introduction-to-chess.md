Chess is a game that has spanned numerous centuries and is enjoyed across the world. While the rules of the game are simple to understand, chess is one of the most difficult games to master and excel in. Strategy, knowledge, and an ability to think ahead are keys to beating your opponent in this ultimate match of wits. Eight pawns, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, a queen and a king are your tools to victory with the goal of capturing your enemy’s king. Carefully navigating these pieces across the 64 individual black and white squares of the chess board will help your chances of victory even more.

Widely accepted to have originated in India around the 6th century, chess has seen a few changes to the original rules while staying true to the original concept of the game. The goal of chess is simple, capture your opponent’s king by putting it in a situation where it is being attacked by one of your pieces and unable to escape. Achieving this goal can range from a simple task to an absolute strategic battle from both sides. Being able to attack your opponent while also keeping your own pieces and king safe from harm is what makes chess one of the most difficult games to truly master.
<h2>Beginner Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
Winning a game of chess can be challenging at times, especially when you are unsure of the rules or what some of the important pieces are. Here are three quick tips and tricks that you can use to help you during your next game:
<ol>
 	<li><b>Know how your pieces move across the board.</b> While this seems obvious, knowing how your pieces move will help you when you are planning your next move or capture on the board. For example, bishops can only move diagonally across the board while rooks can only move in a straight lane horizontally and vertically. Knights have a movement that can best be described as an “L-Shape”, moving two spaces in any direction and then one additional square to the left or right. Queens can move any number of squares in any direction, except for the way the knight moves. Pawns can only move one square forward, except when it is the very first move that pawn makes in which you may move it two squares. Pawns can only capture a piece if it is one square diagonally forward of it’s current position. Finally, the king can move in any direction like the queen but only one square at a time.</li>
 	<li><b>Don’t just attack your opponent every chance you get!</b> It is a common situation on the chessboard. You see that one of your pieces can attack and capture one of your opponent’s pieces and give you an advantage. However, you should take a second and think about what might happen if you make that move. Does it make one of your pieces suddenly a target? Will your opponent be able to more easily attack your king? Just because a capturing move seems like a good idea, always take the time to double check the board!</li>
 	<li><b>Always remember to watch your king!</b> Whenever the king is under direct attack from an enemy piece, they are in check. If the player is unable to move their king out of safety or capture/block the attacking piece, they suffer checkmate and the game ends. When you are planning out your next moves, always keep an eye on the openings and potential attacks your opponent might be able to make on your king. Remember, the game ends if your king can not escape an attack. Proper defense is crucial to ensuring a better chance at victory!</li>
