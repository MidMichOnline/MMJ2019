Lisa is looking for recommendations for car rentals.

Discussion Thread follows below.
<ul>
 	<li>Lisa: Are there any car rental places in the area? Enterprise doesn’t have any cars. I need a car for a few days as my car is being looked at to see if it’s repairable.
<ul>
 	<li>Scott: Check with a car dealership</li>
 	<li>Lisa: the dealerships are so expensive. $500 deposit and that doesn’t include the daily rental fee.</li>
 	<li>Scott: Lisa, The closest rental place is Mount Pleasant or probably Freeland at the airport.</li>
 	<li>Lisa: Scott, that is what I was afraid of. Was hoping there was a secret spot locally! Thank you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Jill: The place you are getting your car repaired doesn't offer a loaner car?
<ul>
 	<li>Lisa: Jill, no otherwise I wouldn’t be asking</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Dusty: used rent cars. Link Posted.
