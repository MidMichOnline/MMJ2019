(August 24, 2019) The Mount Pleasant-based Thrive Church is matching families with children who are in need of new shoes for school with donors. Anybody who would like to donate new shoes are encouraged to complete the following form: <a href="https://thrivechurchmi.com/give?fbclid=IwAR1FFCYDDBJpLd8lSa3FkmxC4hLQw-nXJ2bzIbUJGWosw4MVaQhxqi7yJXM">https://thrivechurchmi.com/give</a>.

On Friday we posted this picture on Thrive Church MI's facebook page and the response has overwhelming. We simply said, if your kids need shoes for School, we'd love to help. . . . I just spent time praying over all the names who have asked for shoes and read through the responses. My heart is just breaking. The needs are so great! People with cancer and sickness and no jobs. So much suffering. I hope and pray that these gifts of shoes will be a huge blessing to these families and give those kids a lift. If you want to help us, we would love it! Head here: https://thrivechurchmi.com/give. And just select Shoe Fund. It's amazing how much of a LIFT a brand new pair of shoes brings someone!
