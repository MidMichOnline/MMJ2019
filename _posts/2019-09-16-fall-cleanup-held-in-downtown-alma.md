<b>The Gist</b>

Volunteers from Alma College, Alma High School, and the Alma community worked together over the weekend as a part of Keep Alma Beautifulâ€™s Fall cleanup in downtown Alma. The group planted mum plants, picked up trash, cleaned up Riverside Park, around the Alma Library, portions of the river walk, and parking lots.
