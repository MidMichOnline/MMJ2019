The third annual Farm to Table Dinner will be held Thursday, August 8 starting at 6 p.m. The meal takes place outdoors in the middle of 2nd Street in front of the Shepherd Post Office. Tickets are $30 per person and includes appetizers, the main course, and dessert all prepared by local chefs using locally grown ingredients.

The event will also include live performances by the Palooka Brothers, a silent auction, and door prizes.

Proceeds raised by the event will go to Shepherd’s St. Vincent de Paul food pantry.
