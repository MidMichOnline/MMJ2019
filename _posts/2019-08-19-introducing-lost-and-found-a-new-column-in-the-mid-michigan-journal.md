<em>Editor's Note: This Fall, the Mid Michigan Journal will be introducing a new column featuring the stories behind pets that are lost and found written by Tasha Potts. I asked her to write this introduction.</em>

Hello my name is Tasha. I started the missing lost and found pets group in Gratiot county on August 14th 2019. My goal is to make it easier for the community to find their lost pets or for the community to post missing or found animals. I also started the goal in the hopes of helping Dalis to the Rescue with her mission.

I will also be posting stories on the Mid Michigan Journal about the status of the lost pets that have been reported in the group.
