The Apple Christian Homeschool group will hold a party/kick-off event on October 4 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. in Alma, Michigan. Parents who home school their kids and are interested in learning more about the group are welcomed to attend.

The group meets on Friday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. inside a church in Alma. The cost to participate is $60 per family plus a $10 background check fee. Participating parents help teach classes on subjects such as gym, art and science. Students who are old enough to attend between preschool and the 12th grade are eligible.
