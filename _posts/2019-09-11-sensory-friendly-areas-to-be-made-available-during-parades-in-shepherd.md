<b>The Gist</b>

The Shepherd Police Department announced that it will be setting up sensory-friendly areas for the parades that are held in the Village of Shepherd.

“We are very excited to announce that for EVERY parade held in the Village of Shepherd,” the Shepherd Police Department wrote on its Facebook page. “Simply put, these designated areas will be ones with less lights and less sounds for those [who] have issues with these things.”

The SPD will announce the location of the areas prior to each parade, the post said.
