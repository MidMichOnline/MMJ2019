<b>The Gist</b>

The Shepherd Police Department posted last night that Navaeh Snyder had been located, and that she was with Police Chief Luke Sawyer. A follow up message thanked the community for its support on behalf of Naveh’s family.

“Her family greatly appreciates all of the thoughts, prayers and shares of her picture and FB posts. They ask that you respect their privacy during this time,” the post on the Shepherd Police Department’s Facebook page read.

The post also said that the investigation into Navaeh’s absence over the last few days was still active.
