<b>The Gist</b>

(August 28, 2019) Freshmen and Sophomores with an interest in a career in healthcare and who attend a secondary school in the Mid Michigan area are eligible to attend a Health Career Pipeline Program being offered by Central Michigan University and the Mid Central Michigan Area Health Education Center this Fall.

According to information released by CMU’s College of Medicine, students who attend this program will “be empowered to lead, communicate, and interact through indirect learning and engagement. Under the guidance of trained and selected Central Michigan University undergraduate mentors and Central Michigan University medical student facilitators, participants will explore career options, engage in hands-on clinical simulation experiences learn how to navigate the post-secondary environment and become more attuned to their own health and wellness.”

Applications are due September 13. The nine-week program starts on September 30 and runs until November 25.
