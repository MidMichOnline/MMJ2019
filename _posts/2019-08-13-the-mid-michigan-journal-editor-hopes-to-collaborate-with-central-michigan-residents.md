The Mid Michigan Journal is seeking submissions of news, event information, essays, and blog posts from residents in central Michigan.

I am also open to working with students with an interest and talent for journalism, writing, editing, videography, broadcast, photography, and social media on news assignments or media production projects for the news website.

For example, a high school senior from Alma is currently working on an article about last week's Shepherd Community Farm to Table based on interviews and notes that she took during the event. There are lots of upcoming news stories which offer the same kind of opportunity for experience.

Anybody who is interested in learning more should contact me at <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a> or by phone at (989) 488-8207.
