Visitors to the Mid Michigan Journal are now able to listen to live voice discussion from the news website. To listen, click the speaker icon displayed inside the widget located towards the bottom of the sidebar on the right side of almost any page on the news site. You will be able to listen to any ongoing discussions.

Anybody who is interested in participating in the discussions can do so by downloading the Zello app from the app store (for iOS devices) and then joining the Mid Michigan Journal channel. Approved members of the channel will be able to share information, questions, or their opinion live via the audio channel. Find out more information about Zello by going <a href="https://zello.com/channels/k/g0lsU">here</a>.

If you have questions about how to get started, contact Jon Morgan via email at <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.

Stay tuned for announcements about upcoming live audio discussion nights and other events.
