(August 25, 2019, From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811/posts/10157282489003445">Jay Gross</a>) Got charity? Carrie Jaloszynski Bennett contacted me and is about 40 short...Here is what’s up:

“Last year all 175 of it Kindergarteners and TK students at Shepherd and Winn were sponsored. We are so thankful that each child received a collection of quality books to read with their family. We would love to be able to support the entire class again. Each month I receive the Scholastic Book Club fliers to send home. Unfortunately, most of my students never order. This means they are not adding to their home libraries. BUT, THIS CAN ALL CHANGE!!! Here’s the idea: Scholastic has books every month that are $1. I would LOVE for each of my students to be able to bring home one new book each month during the school year from September to May. Seem crazy and unrealistic? Keep reading! If I select a $1 book each month, that’s only $9 per child (for a FULL school year). Would anyone be interested in “sponsoring” a Shepherd Kindergartener? You could mail me a check for $9 made out to “Scholastic Book Club” and that child would get a new book to take home and KEEP each month! I would then send in all of the checks together and it would credit my Scholastic account. If you’re interested in helping out with this project let me know! Message me or comment if you would like to sponsor a child and send a check made out to Scholastic Book Clubs to:

Thank you so much for helping support Shepherd kindergarteners and our classrooms!! New books are always so fun and it’s a great way to build a life long love of reading!!! I appreciate it more than words can explain! Please do not feel obligated or pressured, I just thought would give it a try. Thank you for your consideration!

Thank you so much!! Got help? Please feel free to message Carrie with ? Or concern. Appreciated!!
