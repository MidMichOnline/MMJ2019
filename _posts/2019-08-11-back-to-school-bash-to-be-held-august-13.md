The public is welcome to attend the 8th annual “Back to School Bash” being held August 13 from 5 p.m. - 7 p.m. inside the Shepherd Little Salt River Park. This year, the Shepherd United Methodist Church, which has hosted the event in previous years, is partnering with Project AWARE to provide support and fun to families with students in grades Kindergarten through fifth grade.

The event is geared towards families with students in kindergarten through fifth grade and will include a wide range of fun activities. School supplies will be given to the 200 students to register at the event. There will also be free hot dogs, pizza, homemade cookies, snow cones, and popcorn.

A wide range of local agencies will be present to provide attendees with information about different community resources including Clothing Inc., a source of free clothing for those in need hosted by the Nonprofit center at 1114 W. High Street, The Mount Pleasant Care Store which is hosted by the Mount Pleasant Community church and is located at 1400 W Broomfield St, and therapeutic horsemanship program Hopewell Ranch, located at 6410 W Leiter Rd. Hopewell Ranch will provide therapy ponies and donkeys. In addition, Dalis Hitchcock of Dalis to the Rescue will be present with an assortment of small animals for adoption, as well as her newly-released children’s book.

Alaina Sunken, event coordinator for Project AWARE, said that the event is expected to be a “great opportunity for family to spend time together before the school year starts.”
