<b>The Gist</b>

Nevaeh Snyder is safe and, according to the Shepherd Police Department, the man who was arrested for accosting her is in the Isabella County Jail and awaiting arraignment.

Here is a timeline based on the information that has been shared so far by the Shepherd Police Department:
<ul>
 	<li>On Thursday, September 12 at around 10 a.m., fourteen-year-old Snyder was last seen leaving the Shepherd High School.</li>
 	<li>On Friday, September 13, an Endangered Missing Advisory (EMA) was filed with the Michigan State Police.</li>
 	<li>On the afternoon of Saturday, September 14, an arrest warrant was obtained by the SPD for a 21-year-old man from Midland on charges of Accosting a Child for Immoral Purposes. The SPD then contacted the Michigan State Police Fugitive Team and worked out a plan on how to locate the individual.</li>
 	<li>At around 6 p.m. on Saturday, Snyder was reported by the SPD on Facebook as having been located and was being accompanied by Chief Sawyer. Once the teen was safe, law enforcement began to focus on locating the suspect. The SPD stayed in contact with Snyder’s family for the rest of Saturday until early Sunday morning. The suspect contacted the family before midnight, and it seemed likely that he might go to their home. The Isabella County Sheriff’s Office was dispatched to the home after 1 a.m. and the suspect was arrested.</li>
</ul>
The identity of the suspect was not released because his arraignment is still pending. The Facebook post also said that more charges could follow, and others might also be charged as a part of the investigation.
