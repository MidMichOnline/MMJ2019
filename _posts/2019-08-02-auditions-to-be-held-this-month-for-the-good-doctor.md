Interested members of the community are invited to audition for an upcoming production of "The Good Doctor" to be put on by the Gratiot County Players. Auditions will take place August 12th and 13th at 6:30 p.m. inside the Strand Theatre. According to a post by Joshua Ryan, "This show is a delightful comedy by Neil Simon containing a number of short sketches adapted from the short stories of Anton Chekhov. It has parts in it for a variety of ages, and if you're new to the stage but always wanted to give it a shot, it's a great opportunity to get involved."

A copy of the script is on hold at the Alma Public Library for anybody to review up until auditions.

The performance dates for the play are October 18-20 and 25-27.
