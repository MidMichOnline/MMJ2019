Itâ€™s summertime, which means we, as parents and caregivers, need to be extra cautious when traveling with children. Unfortunately, the country has seen 17 deaths due to Pediatric Vehicular Heatstroke already this year, and that number is bound to climb. Here are some tips to on how to keep your child this summer, as suggested by NoHeatStroke.org:
<ul>
 	<li>Never leave a child unattended in a vehicle. not even for a minute !</li>
 	<li>If you see a child unattended in a hot vehicle call 9-1-1.</li>
 	<li>Be sure that all occupants leave the vehicle when unloading. don't overlook sleeping babies.</li>
 	<li>Always lock your car and ensure children do not have access to keys or remote entry devices. teach children that vehicles are never to be used as a play area.</li>
 	<li>If a child is missing, always check the pool first, and then the car, including the trunk.</li>
 	<li>Keep a stuffed animal in the carseat and when the child is put in the seat place the animal in the front with the driver. or place your purse, briefcase or cell phone in the back seat as a reminder that you have your child in the car.</li>
 	<li>make "look before you leave" a routine whenever you get out of the car.</li>
 	<li>Have a plan that your childcare provider will call you if your child does not show up for school.</li>
</ul>
