The Shepherd Train Depot will be seeing several improvements this summer. Currently, a gazebo is under construction, and the caboose is being repainted. There are also plans to repaint the Shepherd Train Depotâ€™s mail car.

The construction of the gazebo and other projects are being funded by proceeds from the Depot Auction as well as donations from residents.
