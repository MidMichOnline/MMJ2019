<b>The Gist</b>

(August 28, 2019) Members of Alma College’s Tau Kappa Epsilon will be hosting a car wash on Saturday, September 28 from 12 p.m. - 5 p.m. to support St. Jude’s cancer research. Will Rose, a member of Alma’s TKE fraternity, said in a Facebook Post, “The money we raise for St. Jude will be used toward advancements in cancer technology, and to help reduce the price of medical bills for those families whose child is battling cancer.”
