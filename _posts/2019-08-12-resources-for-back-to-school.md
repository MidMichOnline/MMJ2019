The Mid Michigan Journal offers several helpful resources for parents, students, and educators on its website.
<ul>
 	<li>Post your questions about your childâ€™s school inside the Answers forum under the <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/questions-dashboard">education category</a>, and help others by responding to their questions with helpful answers or suggestions.</li>
 	<li>Schools can share announcements and other news by submitting <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/submit-news">news tips</a>.</li>
 	<li>Discuss topics related to local schools in the <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/community/schools">Forum</a></li>
</ul>
I am also looking for students or parents from around Mid Michigan who would be interested in blogging about their experiences during the school year. Contact by email via <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a> with questions.
