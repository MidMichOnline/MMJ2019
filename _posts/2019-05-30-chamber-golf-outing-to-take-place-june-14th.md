The Shepherd Chamber of Commerce Annual Golf Outing is set to take place on June 14 at the Maple Creek Golf Course. The event includes 18 holes of golf, awesome raffle items including a pair of diamond earrings courtesy of Trudeau’s Jewerly, and a concert and overnight package compliments of Soaring Eagle Casino and Resort. The event will conclude with a Business After Hours on the clubhouse patio featuring heavy hors d’oeuvres.

Proceeds will benefit future Shepherd Chamber of Commerce events and projects such as the annual Trunk or Treat, Christmas Parade, Santa House, Easter Egg Scramble, and the Roadside Business Directory.
