The Idea forum allows visitors to the site to share news tips or story ideas with the staff of&nbsp;<em>The Mid Michigan Journal.&nbsp;</em>This section can be accessed by clicking on "Story Ideas" in the top navigation menu, or by going to <a href="http://midmichiganjournal.com/story-ideas">http://midmichiganjournal.com/story-ideas</a>. With the page, visitors can either vote up ideas that have already been posted, or use the form on the right hand sidebar to submit an idea of their own. Story suggestions will be reviewed before they are approved and published for review by web visitors.

After you submit your idea, you will be notified when its status changes. If you have questions about the status of a suggestion, feel free to contact the news site via email sent to <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>.
