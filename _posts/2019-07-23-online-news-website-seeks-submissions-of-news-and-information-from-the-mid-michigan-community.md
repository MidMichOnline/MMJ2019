This month marks the one year anniversary of the launch of <i>The Mid Michigan Journal</i>, a free online community news resource which delivers news and event information to Central Michigan residents.

The public can read stories on the Mid Michigan Journal’s website, http://www.midmichiganjournal.com, Facebook page, email newsletter, or weekly podcast news summary. The site also features an Answers forum, and a business directory.

The MMJ also manages two groups on Facebook centered around central Michigan. There is the Isabella County Pulse, which can be found at http://isabellacounty.midmichiganjournal.com, and the Gratiot County Pulse, which can be found at http://gratiotcounty.midmichiganjournal.com.

Businesses, organizations, and central Michigan residents are also welcome to submit news, opinions, and event information for publication in the Mid Michigan Journal and its different channels. News tips, story ideas, and articles can be emailed to <a href="mailto:editor@midmichiganjournal.com">editor@midmichiganjournal.com</a>. Or, they can be submitted online via the following links:
