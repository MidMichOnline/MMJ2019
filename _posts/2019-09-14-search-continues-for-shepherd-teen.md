<b>The Gist</b>

The search continues for 14-year-old Nevaeh Snyder. She had been last seen leaving the Shepherd High School on Thursday, September 12 at 10 a.m. 9&amp;10 News reports that Nevaeh’s sister, Tiara Kyser, drove to the Shepherd High School to pick up Nevaeh for an appointment, but she wasn’t there.

Friday evening, the Michigan State Police had released a missing endangered advisory. WNEM5 reports that Nevaeh is 4-foot-11-inches and weighs 130 pounds. She has blonde hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a gray Nike sweatshirt, jeans, and black and pink tennis shoes.

Family members have posted on Nevaeh’s Facebook Profile.

“This is my cousin,” wrote Latricia Ann. “She went to school yesterday morning. [She attended] her 1st and 2nd hour, left around 10 a.m. before her 3rd hour. No one knows where she went, who she’s with [and] no one has seen [or] heard from her since. Her phone goes straight to voicemail and she had not called anyone.”

“Everyone plz keep your eyes open for my great niece she never came home from school and [we’re] all worried about her,” wrote Melanie Smades.

Anybody with information is asked to call the Isabella County Central Dispatch at (989) 773-1000.
