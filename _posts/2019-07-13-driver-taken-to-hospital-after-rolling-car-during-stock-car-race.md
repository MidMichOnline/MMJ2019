Gabrielle Susdorf is in the hospital for injuries sustained after crashing her car during the 4 cylinder stock car competition at the Mount Pleasant Speedway Friday night. Chris Ryan, who attended the race, said that Susdorf’s car flipped approximately six times during the crash. Susdorf is currently being treated at Saginaw Covenant Hospital for injuries.

The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MPSpeedway/">Mount Pleasant Speedway</a> posted photos of Susdorf’s car and a message asking its racing family to wish Susdorf a speedy recovery.

“Sending this young lady and her family thoughts and prayers for a speedy recovery,” Ryan posted on his Facebook profile. “One thing I always count on is seeing Gabrielle’s smile every Friday at the pit booth.”

Susdorf is among the youngest drivers to compete in the 4 cylinder class for stock cars.
